Under construction

For now I created a basic login page and landing page. The authentication works as intended.

The elevator pitch for this project is basicly:

"This fullstack application gives users the opportunity to make lists of all their products per location.
The user can keep track of the content of the product for easier restocking and of the expiration date to prevent healthisues.
I also want to make use of notifications so I either make an Android app or make a PWA of it"

I plan on making the core features soon and I also try to make a test account with some limitations for demo purposes.
